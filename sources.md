## Sources

### Lattice Theory / Concept Lattices / FCA
- [Lattices, closures systems and implication bases: A survey of structural aspects and algorithms](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.proxy.library.oregonstate.edu/science/article/pii/S0304397516306806?via%3Dihub#br0290)
  - survey of lattice theory in connection with concept lattices, 'implication bases', and the algorithms behind them
  - [SUPPORTS] provides a basis for concept lattices and lattice theory, in particular providing a definition of the closure system used in Section 2.2. Definition number 8

### Program Construction
- [PCEX: Interactive Program Construction Examples for Learning Programming](https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.proxy.library.oregonstate.edu/doi/abs/10.1145/3279720.3279726)
  - talks about interactive examples that build up things
  - "The innovative idea behind PCEX is to create “rich examples” that support free exploration and challenge the student", pg. 2
  - [SUPPORTS] indicating that free exploration of material is a critical part of learning programming, and that our approach supports structuring this exploration
- [Program Construction Examples in Computer Science Education: From Static Text to Adaptive and Engaging Learning Technology](https://search.library.oregonstate.edu/permalink/f/1g9lfhc/TN_cdi_eric_primary_ED596007)
  - talks about the importance of worked examples, building up knowledge
  - [SUPPORTS] indicating other work related to the significance of changing the way examples are presented based on a student's understanding, which varies over a class

### Language Learning
- [Teaching the Art of functional programming using automated grading (experience report)](https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.proxy.library.oregonstate.edu/doi/10.1145/3341719)
  - talks about teaching OCaml in an online setting
  - [SUPPORTS] showing that an online format is more accessible (supporting my prototype approach), and has been found so in other work
- [Teaching Abstraction in Computer Science to 7th Grade Students](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372143)
  - talks about significance of abstraction, and observations of abstraction techniques in a classroom that focused on 'Scratch'.
  - [SUPPORTS] Notion that abstraction is a difficult concept, but a critical concept to teach in problem solving in CS
- [Studying the difference between natural and programming language corpora](https://search.library.oregonstate.edu/permalink/f/1g9lfhc/TN_cdi_gale_infotracacademiconefile_A594563350)
  - notion that natural language and programming languages share similarities, in particular the notion of native speakers vs. English language Learners, which presents an idea that non-native speakers (and coders) tend to write more repetitive stuff (use what they know...okay)
  - [SUPPORTS] the notion that limited understanding in a domain may lead to poor solutions (using multiple low-level constructs that could be replaced by fewer high-level ones, using if-then-else instead of loops for example), and that this is related to the level of understanding of the programmer in that language (syntax & what it does is important to know)
- [Does syntax highlighting help programming novices?](https://search.library.oregonstate.edu/permalink/f/1g9lfhc/TN_cdi_gale_infotracacademiconefile_A547632235)
  - indicates that this doesnot help, and is 'wasted feedback channel', could be used to help carry type-related information (or something else)
  - [SUPPORTS] We can use coloration to convey more important aspects of our langauges, namely the programs & concepts...
  - Not so sure about this one...
- [Gradually Learning Programming Supported by a Growable Programming Language](https://search.library.oregonstate.edu/permalink/f/1g9lfhc/TN_cdi_crossref_primary_10_1109_TETC_2015_2446192)
  - self-explanatory
  - [SUPPORTS] Notion that syntax is a limiting factor, which ties into how we view unique syntactic categories as concepts, and this supports our reasoning in this system that limited introduction of syntax is important, such that knowledge is built
  - "The gradual introduction of programming concepts helps the students to exclusively focus on the new concepts. This has the benefit that at any time any example the teacher shows to the students will only use those concepts that the students are acquainted with" (excellent quote), where concepts are abstract notions (control flows, expressions, functions, etc.)
  - HOWEVER, they also note that the 'need for a precise syntactic pattern' is correlated with 'let me just pass' attitudes
- [A Systematic Literature Review on Teaching and Learning Introductory Programming in Higher Education](https://search.library.oregonstate.edu/permalink/f/1g9lfhc/TN_cdi_crossref_primary_10_1109_TE_2018_2864133)
  - Talks about study of body of work that has been produced on learning CS through introductory problems
  - [SUPPORTS] that problem solving is a huge part of CS, and that learning syntax is also a difficult challenge behind motivation and problem solving
- [Expanding computer science education in schools: understanding teacher experiences and challenges](https://search.library.oregonstate.edu/permalink/f/1g9lfhc/TN_cdi_crossref_primary_10_1080_08993408_2016_1257418)
  - this suggests known issues with K-12 instructors that are teaching CS, in particular isolation, lack of adequate CS background, limited professional dev. resources
  - [SUPPORTS] lack of background & prof. dev resources are a bad combination, this seeks to provide a prof. dev. resource to build background
- [Computer Science Pedagogical Content Knowledge: Characterizing Teacher Performance](https://search.library.oregonstate.edu/permalink/f/1g9lfhc/TN_cdi_crossref_primary_10_1145_3303770)
  - talks about measuring content knowledge to help teachers out in CS, talks about identifying this knowledge in various ways, but different from what I see here
  - [SUPPORTS] they find that prior teaching experience does not influence performance, and that

### Prototype Components
- [D3 Graphviz, Github](https://github.com/magjac/d3-graphviz)
  - supplies an implementation of GraphViz in the browser for converting files written in DOT into an SVG rendering of a graph

## Unused sources
- [Earthworm: Automated Decomposition Suggestion](https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.proxy.library.oregonstate.edu/doi/epdf/10.1145/3279720.3279736)
  - not useful, but talks about decomposition tools to teach that concept
- [Some paper on teaching recursion](https://search.library.oregonstate.edu/permalink/f/1g9lfhc/TN_cdi_doaj_primary_oai_doaj_org_article_1f52d79b705445b2930b35c178722510)
  - Talks about the various ways recursion is taught
- [Jennifer & Shannon's Story Programming Paper](https://search.library.oregonstate.edu/permalink/f/1g9lfhc/TN_cdi_acm_primary_3287397)
  - no difference...so maybe I can use that?...the notion that if that doesn't make a difference, possibly the way in which the language is presented does not impact the learning?
